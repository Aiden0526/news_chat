    "Step 1": "The risk of AI lies in how it is used and the potential misuse of its power. AI is a tool that can be used for both good and bad purposes, just like any other tool. It can be used to improve our lives in various ways, such as in healthcare, transportation, and language translation. However, if AI falls into the wrong hands or is used without proper ethical considerations, it can pose risks and challenges. For example, AI could be used to spread misinformation or for malicious purposes. It could also lead to job displacement if not implemented and managed properly. Therefore, it is important for us humans to make responsible decisions and use AI for positive reasons, while also working towards understanding and addressing its potential risks and limitations."
