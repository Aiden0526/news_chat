    "Step 1": "The risk of AI can vary depending on its application and how it is used. One potential risk is the potential for biased or discriminatory outcomes, as AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, it can lead to biased decisions and perpetuate existing inequalities. Another risk is the potential for job displacement, as AI and automation technologies have the potential to replace human workers in certain tasks and industries. This can result in unemployment and economic disruptions. Additionally, there are concerns about the misuse of AI and the potential for malicious actors to use it for nefarious purposes, such as spreading misinformation or conducting cyberattacks. Finally, there are ethical concerns surrounding AI, particularly in areas such as privacy, surveillance, and the potential for autonomous weapons. These risks highlight the importance of responsible development and regulation of AI technologies to mitigate potential harms."
